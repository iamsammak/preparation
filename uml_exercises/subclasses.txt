Top down design

Specialization constraints
- rather than the usual cardinality/multiplicity symbols, the subclass
association line is labeled with specialization constraints

Two dimensions
  incomplete vs complete
  disjoint vs overlapping


In an INCOMPLETE specialization, also called partial specialization,
only some individuals of the parent class are specialized (that is, have unique attributes)
Other individuals of the parent class have only the common attributes
Ex. Dorm Student --- Housing RA
(I'm thinking more top down)

In an COMPLETE specialization, all individuals of the parent class
have one or more unique attributes that are not common to the
generalized (parent) class
(I'm thinking more bottom up)
ex. Lot and citylot/countylot

In a DISJOINT specialization, also called an exclusive specialization,
an individual of the parent class may be a member of
only one specialized subclass
Ex. GradStudent --- TeachingAsst and ResearchAsst
  You can't be a TA and a RA

In an OVERLAPPING specialization, an individual of the parent class
may be a member of more than one of the specialized subclasses
