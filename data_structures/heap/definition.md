Heap
- a tree like data structure where each node must be ordered with respect to the value of its children.
- the ordering must persist throughout the entire tree
- max heap and min heap
  - max heap - parent node values are greater than children
  - min heap - parent node values are less than children

Binary Heap
  - specific implementation of a heap whereby a parent can have no more than two children


Main use - Priority Queue

Higher or lower valued data points bubble to the front of the queue and therefore accesed first
